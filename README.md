# recipes

Recipes is a (mind-numbingly) simple recipe project I am doing through The Odin Project (TOP). The project will implement an unstyled (no CSS) website that has a homepage that links to a few recipe pages. Its purpose is to improve my ability and understanding of how to use git as version control for a website. It has no other utility unfortunately.
